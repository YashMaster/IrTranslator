IrTranslator
============

Not all TVs can be controlled with the Xbox One for some reason. If you find yourself in that situation, use an Arduino + IrTranslator to translate the Xbox's signals into ones that actually work. 

This is basically just a tiny wrapper over Ken Shirriff's IR Library so he deserves all the credit. His original work can be found here: https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote
